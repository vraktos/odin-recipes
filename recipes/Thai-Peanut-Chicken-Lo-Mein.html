    <p>You can add additional vegetables as desired (broccoli, snow peas, etc.)</p><p>Though you may then need to increase the amount of peanut sauce if you add significant amounts of veggies.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Â¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Direction</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 2 quarts lightly salted water to a boil. Cook chow mein in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Whisk soy sauce, peanut butter, 4 teaspoons vegetable oil, sugar, vinegar, and 4 teaspoons sesame oil together in a bowl until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute chicken, garlic, and ginger in hot oil until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove chicken mixture with a slotted spoon to a bowl, retaining drippings in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Heat an additional 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon sesame oil in the skillet with the drippings; saute mushrooms until fragrant, 15 to 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Return the chicken to the skillet; add drained chow mein noodles, bean sprouts, and green onion. Toss mixture to distribute chicken and vegetables throughout the noodles. Drizzle peanut sauce over the noodles and toss to coat; cook until sauce is warmed, about 1 minute. Remove skillet from heat and garnish with cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
