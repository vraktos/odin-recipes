    <h2>A delicious way to top leftover pasta!</h2>
    <p>I had some nice firm tomatoes that I sliced up then seasoned each slice before topping them with grated parmesan</p>
    <p>dried basil, and a bit of olive oil. I baked them until tender </p><p>and the cheese had melted. These tomatoes paired perfectly with the potatoes and beef and tasted delicious.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary, leaves stripped and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush baking sheet with about 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Arrange tomato slices on the baking sheet. Sprinkle rosemary and garlic over tomatoes and brush with remaining olive oil; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tomatoes are tender, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
